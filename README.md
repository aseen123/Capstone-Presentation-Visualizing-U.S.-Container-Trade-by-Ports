# US Port Container Volume Analysis (Capstone Project)

## Overview
This capstone project analyzes historical **U.S. container port volumes** to identify long-term trends, growth patterns, and differences in performance among major ports. The project uses real-world data to explore how container traffic reflects broader economic activity and supply chain behavior.

The analysis is conducted in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and is supported by a cleaned historical dataset.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze container volume trends across U.S. ports
- Compare growth patterns between major ports
- Visualize changes in container throughput over time
- Apply data analysis and visualization techniques to a real-world dataset
- Communicate insights clearly through charts and presentation

---

## Dataset
**File:** `container-ports-2000-2017.csv`

**Description:**
- Historical container volume data for major U.S. ports
- Time range: 2000–2017
- Measures annual container throughput (TEUs)

Data cleaning and preprocessing are performed within the notebook.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Analysis Highlights
- Year-over-year container volume trends
- Comparison of top-performing U.S. ports
- Identification of ports with significant growth or stagnation
- Visual exploration of long-term trade and logistics patterns

---

## Results & Insights
- Container volumes show steady long-term growth with periods of fluctuation
- A small number of ports handle a majority of U.S. container traffic
- Growth rates vary significantly across ports and regions
- Economic cycles and trade conditions are reflected in volume changes

Detailed findings and visualizations are available in the notebook and presentation.
